# üåå StarWars - Angular Application

Welcome to **StarWars**, an Angular application that immerses you in the Star Wars universe! This project leverages the [Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi.py4e.com/) to fetch and display data about characters, planets, starships, and more. The application is styled using **Bootstrap** for a responsive and modern user interface.

## üìã Installation Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adptCode/starwars.git
cd starwars
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Fake Backend 
This application requires a mock backend for authentication, you must set it up using `json-server-auth`. Ensure you have `json-server-auth` installed globally or install it in your project.

```bash
npx json-server-auth db.json --port 3000
```

This will start the fake backend server at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Development Server
```bash
ng serve -o
```

This command will compile the application and automatically open it in your default browser at `http://localhost:4200/`. The application supports hot-reloading, so any changes you make to the source files will reflect in real-time.

## üåê Consuming the Star Wars API (SWAPI)

The application interacts with the [Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi.py4e.com/) to retrieve data about various entities in the Star Wars universe. SWAPI provides endpoints for different resources such as people, planets, films, species, vehicles, and starships.

**Example API Endpoints:**

- **People**: `https://swapi.py4e.com/api/people/`
- **Planets**: `https://swapi.py4e.com/api/planets/`
- **Starships**: `https://swapi.py4e.com/api/starships/`

For detailed documentation on the available endpoints and data structure, refer to the [SWAPI Documentation](https://swapi.py4e.com/documentation).
